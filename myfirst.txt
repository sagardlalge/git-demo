git status -> To check which files are not pushed to github
git add -> To add those files to github
git commit -> commit changes (write nice informative commit message)
git push -> To upload/publish the changes to github
git checkout -> To switch branch or commit eg: git checkout commit_id OR git checkout branch_name
